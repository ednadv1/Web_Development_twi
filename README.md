## Description

Twitter clone app with social github login authentication using react, webpack, jsx syntax and firebase as a service.
---
## Installation

To work with this project locally, first install all dependecies:

```
npm install
```

To build and run the project, project runs on port 3000.

```
npm start
```

To make the final build before pushing to production:

```
npm run production 
```

I recommend reading [firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) to host and use realtime database for this project.

In a near future, I want to do a clone of this project to re-write it with the new React-hooks syntax. Once I do it, I will link it here, so you can appreciate the difference.
